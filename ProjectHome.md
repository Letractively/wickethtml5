# Wicket & HTML5 Showcase #
The web is all abuzz with HTML5. I'm a fan of Apache Wicket. So, why not try out how HTML5 integrates with Wicket applications? This project is a small Wicket application showing how HTML5 and Wicket can be married.

# Features #
This showcase contains the following features. More will be added.

  * Integrating JavaScript with Behaviors
  * Using Wicket's AJAX Debug Window for your own JavaScript
  * Storing form data in IndexedDB

# Usage #
Download the ZIP file over the downloads tab above or check out the sources via Subversion (see "source" tab). It's a Maven project which can be viewed via the following methods:
  * call "mvn package" once and then simply start the class de.adesso.wickethtml5.Start as java application. The application is then available at "http://localhost:8080/"
  * call "mvn package" in the project dir and deploy the war file that will be created in the target dir to any servlet container of your choice.

# Preview #

Here's a screen of how the showcase looks. In the nav bar to the left you can choose a feature that will be shown in the center. The lower left corner displays some info about which java classes are responsible for the feature.
