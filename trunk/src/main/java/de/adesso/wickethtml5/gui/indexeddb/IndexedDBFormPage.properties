marginalTitle=Store Form input to IndexedDB
marginalText=The data you input into the form to the right will <strong>not</strong> be submitted to the server. Instead, the <span>IndexedDBFormBehavior</span> intercepts the form submit and calls a javascript function to store the data locally in the browser's IndexedDB. Also see the classes <span>IndexedDBFormPage</span> and <span>EmployeeForm</span>.
